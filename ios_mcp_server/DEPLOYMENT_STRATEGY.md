# 🚀 iOS MCP Server Deployment Strategy

You have two MCP servers in your project. Here's how to use each one:

## 🎯 Quick Decision Guide

### Want to deploy on Railway/Cloud?
→ Use **`fastmcp_server.py`** (HTTP/SSE transport)
→ Follow "Railway Deployment" section below

### Want to use with Claude Desktop?
→ Use **`server/mcp_server.py`** (stdio transport)
→ Must run locally on macOS with Xcode

### Want BOTH?
→ Deploy FastMCP to Railway for API access
→ Run traditional MCP locally for Claude Desktop
→ They can coexist!

## 📦 1. Railway Deployment (FastMCP)

### Prerequisites
- Railway account
- GitHub repository

### Steps

1. **Ensure FastMCP is the entry point**
   Your Dockerfile already uses `fastmcp_server.py` ✅

2. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Railway deployment configuration"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Deploy on Railway**
   - Go to https://railway.app/new
   - Connect your GitHub repo
   - Railway will auto-detect Dockerfile
   - Add environment variable: `RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT=production`

4. **Test deployment**
   ```bash
   # Health check
   curl https://your-app.railway.app/health
   
   # Root endpoint
   curl https://your-app.railway.app/
   ```

### What Works on Railway
- ✅ Health monitoring endpoints
- ✅ SSE transport for API access
- ✅ Tool definitions and metadata
- ❌ Actual iOS automation (needs local simulator)
- ❌ Claude Desktop connection (needs stdio)

## 💻 2. Local Claude Desktop Setup

### Use the Traditional MCP Server

1. **Create config for Claude Desktop**
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "ios-automation": {
         "command": "python",
         "args": ["-m", "server.mcp_server"],
         "cwd": "/path/to/ios_mcp_server"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Run locally**
   ```bash
   cd ios_mcp_server
   python -m server.mcp_server
   ```

### What Works Locally
- ✅ Full iOS automation
- ✅ Claude Desktop integration
- ✅ Screenshot capture
- ✅ App control
- ✅ UI automation

## 🔄 3. Hybrid Approach

You can run both:

1. **Railway**: FastMCP for monitoring/API
2. **Local**: Traditional MCP for Claude Desktop

They serve different purposes and don't conflict.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Railway Deployment

### Current Issue: 502 Bad Gateway

Your Railway deployment is returning 502. Here's the fix checklist:

1. **Port binding** ✅ (Already fixed in code)
2. **Host binding** ✅ (Already fixed to 0.0.0.0)
3. **Dependencies** - Verify all are in requirements.txt
4. **Start command** - Check Dockerfile CMD

### To Debug:

1. **Check Railway logs**
   - Go to Railway dashboard
   - Click on your service
   - View "Logs" tab

2. **Test locally first**
   ```bash
   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Test FastMCP
   python test_railway_deployment.py
   
   # Run locally
   PORT=8000 python fastmcp_server.py
   ```

3. **Common Railway fixes**
   ```bash
   # Ensure latest code is pushed
   git status
   git push origin main
   
   # Force Railway redeploy
   # In Railway dashboard: Settings > Redeploy
   ```

## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

1. **For Railway deployment issues**:
   - Check Railway logs for specific errors
   - Test FastMCP locally first
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed

2. **For Claude Desktop**:
   - Use the traditional MCP server locally
   - Don't try to connect Claude to Railway

3. **For both**:
   - Keep them as separate use cases
   - Document which server to use when
